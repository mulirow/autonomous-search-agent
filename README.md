## How to Run

The project is a visual implementation of five of the most popular search algorithms. We have created a simple map with a smart agent and a food located in it, so that the main goal is to find the path between the start position of the agent and it's final position, where the food is located.

### Terrain
- Plains > Green Squares
- Desert > Yellowish Squares
- Ocean > Blue Squares
- Obstacles > Gray Squares

## Search
- Start point > Blue triangle
- End point > Red triangle
- Visited cells > Pink squares
- Neighbor cells > Tiny Pink squares
- Optimal path > Black dots
- Agent > Light Green circle
- Agent's path > Light Green squares
